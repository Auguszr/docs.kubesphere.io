This guide walks you throungh the steps of KubeSphere minimal installation on [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).

## Prepare a GKE cluster

At first, a standard Kubernetes in GKE is a prerequisite of installing KubeSphere, we've created a GKE cluster with `1.14.8-gke.17` in this demo, and  choosed the `n1-standard-2 (2 vCPU, 7.5 GB memory)` and 3 nodes in **Machine configuration**.

> Note:
> - `n1-standard-2 (2 vCPU, 7.5 GB memory)` is only the minimal requirements that is used for the minimal installation, it's recommended to choose higher machine configuration for production environment.
> - `n1-standard-2 (2 vCPU, 7.5 GB memory)` is only used for minimal installation, KubeSphere 2.1 has decoupled several feature components, which supports installing these pluggable components in an easy way, you have to prepare enough machine configuration before you enable pluggable components, see [Enabling pluggable components installation](../install-on-gke/#enable-pluggable-components).
> - Supported Kubernetes version: `1.13.0 ≤ K8s version < 1.16`.

## Create Tiller Service Account

KubeSphere requires [Helm](https://v2.helm.sh/) **(>= v2.10.0, excluding v2.16.0)** to trigger the installation. By default, [Tiller](https://v2.helm.sh/) is not ready on GKE,  thus we need to install Tiller in advance.

When GKE cluster is ready, we can connenct to Cloud Shell.

![](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20191123122806.png)

Here, we create `helm-rbac.yaml` in GKE as following:


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: tiller
  namespace: kube-system
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tiller
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: tiller
    namespace: kube-system
```

Let's create these resources using kubectl:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f helm-rbac.yaml
```

## Deploy Tiller

Initialize helm using the following command.

```bash
$ helm init --service-account=tiller --tiller-image=gcr.io/kubernetes-helm/tiller:v2.14.1   --history-max 300
```

Check the Tiller status using kubectl, when it display `1/1` that means you are ready to continue.

```bash
$ kubectl get deployment tiller-deploy -n kube-system
```

## Install KubeSphere

Install KubeSphere using kubectl, this command is only trigger the minimal installation by default:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/master/kubesphere-minimal.yaml
```

Verify the real-time logs, when you see the following outputs, congratulation! You can access KubeSphere in your browser.

```bash
$ kubectl logs -n kubesphere-system $(kubectl get pod -n kubesphere-system -l app=ks-install -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -f

NOTES：
  1. After logging into the console, please check the
     monitoring status of service components in
     the "Cluster Status". If the service is not
     ready, please wait patiently. You can start
     to use when all components are ready.
  2. Please modify the default password after login.

## Access KubeSphere console

In this guide, we'll show you how to access KubeSphere console by changing service type to `LoadBalancer`.

![](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20191123124133.png)

Select `Services & Ingress` > `ks-console`, then click `EDIT` and modify the service type from `NodePort` to `LoadBalancer`.

![](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20191123124325.png)

Now, you can access KubeSphere Console using the Endpoints that was generated by GKE.

> Note: In addition to changing the service type to LoadBalancer, you can also access KubeSphere console via `NodeIP:NodePort`, you may need to allow port `30880` in firewall rules.

Log in to KubeSphere console using default account `admin / P@88w0rd`, you'll be able to see its dashboard as following screenshot.

## Enable Pluggable Components

The above installation is only used for minimal installation by default, execute following command to enable more pluggable components installation, make sure your cluster has enough CPU and memory in advance, see [Configuration Table](https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/blob/master/README.md#configuration-table).

<font color=red>For enabling DevOps, OpenPitrix and etcd monitoring installation, you have to create CA and etcd certificates in advance, see [ks-installer](https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/blob/master/README.md#enable-pluggable-components) for complete guide.</font>

```
$ kubectl edit cm -n kubesphere-system ks-installer
```
