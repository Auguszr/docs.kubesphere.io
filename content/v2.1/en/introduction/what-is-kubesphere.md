## Overview

**KubeSphere** is a multi-tenant enterprise-grade container platform built on [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io), with full-stack automated IT operation and streamlined DevOps workflows. KubeSphere provides developer-friendly wizard interface, helps enterprises to build out a more robust and feature-rich platform, includes most common functionalities needed for enterprise Kubernetes strategy, such as the **container engine, Kubernetes resource management, DevOps (CI/CD), application lifecycle management, monitoring, logging, Service Mesh, multi-tenancy, alerting and notification, storage and networking, autoscaling**.

Not only support upstream Kubernetes, KubeSphere works with its users to alleviate the pain points of Kubernetes including **storage, network, security and ease of use**, also develop new features and capabilies not yet included in upstream Kubernetes. KubeSphere provides a complete user experience around Kubernetes that incorporates set of cloud native ecosystem tools, allows developers and DevOps teams use their favorite tools in a single front-end interface. KubeSphere delivers **consolidated views while integrating a wide breadth of ecosystem tools** upon Kubernetes and offer consistent user experience to reduce complexity. Most importantly, these functionalities are loosely coupled with the platform since they are pluggable and optional based on your demands, it will not impact the flexibilty of Kubernetes.

With KubeSphere container platform, developers can focus on application development since KubeSphere helps your enterprise migrate, deploy and manage existing and containerized apps seamlessly accross VM, bare metal, Kubernetes, on-premise and public cloud infrastructures. This platform also helps your Ops team with enterprise-level **observability and troubleshooting, unified monitoring and logging, centralized storage and networking management, easy-to-use CI/CD pipelines**, letting IT operation team embrace DevOps and automated workflows.

## What's New in 2.1

We have decoupled some main feature components and makes them being pluggable. Meanwhile, there were greate enhancements in Helm application store, especially in application lifecycle management.

It's worth mentioning that both **DevOps** and **observability** components have been improved obviously. For example, we added lots of new features including Binary-to-Image, dependency cache support in pipeline, support switch branch and git logs output within DevOps component. We also bring upgrade, enhancements and bugfix in storage, authentication and security, as well as user experience improvements. See [Release Notes For 2.1.0](../../release/release-v210) for details.

## Open Source

KubeSphere has been developing by applying the open source approach since the very beginning. All the relevant source codes and documents are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere).



## Roadmap

**Express Edition => KubeSphere 1.0.x => KubeSphere 2.0.x => KubeSphere 2.1.0 => KubeSphere 2.1.1 => KubeSphere 3.0.0**

> Note: All versions of KubeSphere are **100% open source** and free which has been providing services for a great scale of user community and it has been widely installed and used in development testing and production environments. A large number of services are running smoothly in KubeSphere.
