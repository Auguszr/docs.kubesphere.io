## What's New in 2.1

We have decoupled some main feature components and makes them being pluggable. Meanwhile, there were greate enhancements in Helm application store, especially in application lifecycle management.

It's worth mentioning that both **DevOps** and **observability** components have been improved obviously. For example, we added lots of new features including Binary-to-Image, dependency cache support in pipeline, support switch branch and git logs output within DevOps component. We also bring upgrade, enhancements and bugfix in storage, authentication and security, as well as user experience improvements. See [Release Notes For 2.1.0](../../release/release-v210) for details.

## Open Source

KubeSphere has been developing by applying the open source approach since the very beginning. All the relevant source codes and documents are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere).



## Roadmap

**Express Edition => KubeSphere 1.0.x => KubeSphere 2.0.x => KubeSphere 2.1.0 => KubeSphere 2.1.1 => KubeSphere 3.0.0**

> Note: All versions of KubeSphere are **100% open source** and free which has been providing services for a great scale of user community and it has been widely installed and used in development testing and production environments. A large number of services are running smoothly in KubeSphere.
