[KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io/en/) ️is a multi-tenant cluster management platform which is based on [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io). KubeSphere provides easy-to-use UI to reduce your learning cost for employing the container management platform and make it easier to develop, test and maintain your daily work. It's aimed to resolve the problems relating to Kubernetes’ storage, network, security and its usability. 

In addition, the platform has integrated and optimized a range of functional modules which are suitable for containers. KubeSphere provides enterprises with a complete solution for development, automation operation and maintenance, microservice governance, multi-tanency management. Besides, our platform is also able to manage workload, container cluster, service and network, application orchestration as well as database mirroring and storage.

## What's New in 2.0

In contrast to the express edition, [KubeSphere 2.0](../../release/release-v200) provides richer services for application management, supports multiple functions and flexible configuration to meet the complex business requirements. It supports **master and etcd node HA, visualized CI/CD pipeline, multi-dimensional monitoring and logging, multi-tenancy management, LDAP integration**. Additionally, It added supports for **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), container health check and configurations for Secrets and ConfigMaps** etc. 

The newly added functions include microservice governance, grayscale release, S2i and code quality analysis, etc. What also deserves expecting is **multi-cluster management, big data, AI** and other more complex business scenarios in future releases.

## Open Source

KubeSphere has been developing by applying the open source approach since the very beginning. All the relevant source codes and documents are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere). KubeSphere supports installing on **public cloud, private cloud, VM, BM, Kubernetes and any other infrastructures**. Besides, it supports online and offline installation, which has been tested on **AWS, Google Cloud and Kubernetes, Aliyun, Tencent cloud, Huawei cloud, QingCloud**.


## Roadmap

**Express Edition => KubeSphere 1.0.x => KubeSphere 2.0.x => KubeSphere 2.1.0 (Coming soon!)**

> Note: All versions of KubeSphere are **100% open source** and free which has been providing services for a great scale of user community and it has been widely installed and used in development testing and productions environments centered around Docker and Kubernetes. A large number of services are running smoothly in KubeSphere.
